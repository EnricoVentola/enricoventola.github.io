This blog is a brain dump of projects and ideas. I started it because a good friend keeps telling me I make stuff worth sharing, ocassionaly I forget what I've done... then begrudgingly realise he's right.

I bounce between a few areas: coding, network modernisation, and whatever tech trends look genuinely useful. I’ve worked across the private sector, the military, and international organisations, which has also meant I’ve been lucky enough to travel a fair bit, and share knowledge with lots of unique people.

You’ll probably see the odd post about adventure sports too — it’s my escape from the screen.

I enjoy building and testing ideas in my **HomeLab** and wish to contribute to **open-source** where I can.
